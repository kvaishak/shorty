# shorty.
A simple Application for shortening the URL.
Can be accessed [here](https://shor10.netlify.com/).

I have created this simple URL shortener without the use of any external or internal database using the [jsonbin.io](https://jsonbin.io/) endpoint. This helps in storing the random hash which I create for any lengthy URL which you submit and map it to the respective URL.I have used [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework for providing a aestheticaly pleasing yet simple interface. It is hosted directly from Github with the use of Netlify.

Its pretty straight forward to use. Copy and paste the lengthy URL in the input box provided.
Pressing enter or the button will shorten the URL and copy it into the clipboard.
Paste it anywhere you want.
